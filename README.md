# Secure Web Addressability Network (SWAN)

## Benefits

Everyone wants enhanced transparency & accountability of the data processing
associated with web activity.

### People

-   Enhanced transparency and ease of understanding

-   Persist personalization choices - addresses consent fatigue

-   Enable right to be forgotten

### Publishers

-   Effective engagement

-   Optimize advertising yield

-   Ensure others do not appropriate publisher brand or data

### Marketers

-   Optimize cross-publisher effectiveness

-   Ensure publishers deliver what marketers purchased

## Design Goals

SWAN’s open source, decentralized approach is designed to support a competitive
ecosystem of ad monetization, site-security and fraud prevention solutions.

1.  **SWAN improves consumer experiences** by ensuring global application of
    informed consent and people’s privacy choices across the web.

2.  **SWAN enhances transparency and accountability** via a robust and
    decentralized audit trail of data collection and processing associated with
    people’s privacy choices.

3.  **SWAN supports greater diversity of content** by providing organizations
    equal opportunity to operate their businesses that rely on supply chains
    fueled by interoperable data.

4.  **SWAN enables simple scaled adoption** via low cost and minimal
    implementation hurdles.

## Value

Improves value of all engagement solutions.

1.  SWAN immediately activates Safari and Mozilla inventory

    -   This publisher revenue gain reduces adoption friction

2.  SWAN does NOT rely on signed-in identifiers to operate

    -   This ensures marketers can attribute proper value to exposures across
        publishers

3.  SWAN improves consumer experience by reducing consent fatigue

    -   Publishers earn higher ARPU as people can more quickly access publisher
        content

4.  SWAN provides a transparent, accountable audit log

    -   By relying on non-repudiable keys, people, publishers and marketers have
        a more accountable record of data processing

5.  SWAN is compatible with other projects

    -   Could support UUID or PreBid

# Secure Web Addressability Network (SWAN) - Legal Entity

Status: Draft for initial comment

## Introduction

SWAN needs a governance structure to ensure that it will remain a decentralized,
democratic, utility for the benefit of all, managed for the common good.

It is recognized that SWAN is being created to protect preserve and manage a
scarce resource (User Identity) and to ensure that another limited resource, a
common pool of user identifiers, is to be managed in the community and public
interest for the benefit of consumers.

Consumers need to maintain control over their identity and to that end SWAN aims
to separate identity from a system for managing a common pool of pseudonymous
identifiers and preferences that can be used to provide end users with relevant,
timely, and useful advertising while protecting consumer identity and privacy.

The below provides a skeleton framework for the constitution and membership
rules for the SWAN administration entity (hereafter “SWANCo”) in which SWAN
Operators will be members.

### Company Purpose

-   To set the rules for SWAN Operators to ensure that the SWAN Network is
    managed for the common good.

-   To authorize versions of the open-source code to be run by SWAN Operators.

-   To develop template “model clauses” to be included in all SWAN Operator
    client contracts.

-   Not for profit company limited by guarantee.

-   To administer the complaints and dispute resolution process between SWAN
    Operators.

### Decision-Making

-   The board of directors (the “Board”) shall be made up of one representative
    from each member of SWANCo.

-   An executive board of non-statutory directors will manage the day-to-day
    running of the Company. The executive board shall be appointed by the Board.

-   Certain reserved matters shall require a decision of the Board, by ordinary
    majority.

-   Certain super reserved matters shall require a unanimous decision of the
    Board.

-   There shall be a Chairperson. Should there be a tied vote, the Chairperson
    shall have a casting vote. Should there be a failure to obtain a unanimous
    vote, the Chairperson shall have a casting vote (provided that an ordinary
    majority has been achieved).

-   A meeting of the Board shall be quorate provided that there are a majority
    of the directors present. If a quorum is not achieved, there shall be a
    process to reconvene the Board meeting.

-   Where a director states a conflict of interest in relation to a matter, the
    directors may waive that conflict by a unanimous vote of all directors not
    subject to the conflict.

-   Board decisions can be taken by written resolution as well as following
    meetings of the Board.

### Appointment of Board

-   Each SWAN member shall choose a representative to sit on the Board.

-   The Board shall elect the Chairperson by ordinary majority vote.

-   The Chairperson shall be elected annually.

### Membership Requirements

-   SWAN Operators must be members of the SWANCo.

-   Where an entity applies to become a SWAN operator or member, all existing
    members will have a vote to approve their entry into membership (by ordinary
    majority).

-   Members shall be granted a licence to use the SWAN logo while operating the
    SWAN technology system and using its know-how and source code. The members
    must run the SWAN Network in accordance with the licence terms.

-   SWANCo will have no other members beyond the SWAN Operators.

-   SWAN members will pay a membership fee.

-   SWAN members must meet certain required qualitative criteria in relation to
    their ability to operate manage and maintain the SWAN Network and to provide
    effective distribution, marketing, and sales capability, in particular, but
    not limited to, operational capacity, security, quality of service, and end
    user privacy protections as well as criterial concerning their operational
    systems and processes as professional marketing and sales organisations. The
    Board will publish and review this criteria on an annual basis.

-   In order to ensure the integrity of the SWAN Network, the independence of
    SWAN members, and to prevent member conflicts of interest, no SWAN member or
    affiliate thereof may operate at another level in the advertising ecosystem
    such as in the provision of demand side platform.

-   Members must comply with the membership rules, which shall be set by the
    Board. These shall include a requirement that the SWAN operators upgrade the
    SWAN software being used to the latest version confirmed by SWANCo within 90
    days of confirmation.

-   Members must comply with data protection law and security requirements,
    including meeting ISO 27001 standards.

-   In order to ensure the integrity of the SWAN network, there is expected to
    be a natural limit on the number of members of the SWANCo, being a product
    of system functionality and speed of use.

-   Members must ensure they comply with monitoring of performance and quality
    of service metrics and pass an annual audit. The audit will consider whether
    they comply with the membership rules, the law, and security requirements.
    If a member fails an audit, they shall have 90 days to remedy any
    non-compliance, or their membership shall be terminated and they shall be
    removed from the SWAN network

-   In the light of the current state of technological development and bearing
    in mind the need to achieve a collective and communal high quality and low
    latency user interface load speed, the minimum number of nodes a SWAN
    Operator shall operate shall be 5. The maximum total number of nodes in the
    SWAN network shall be 100 (subject to annual review and potentially revision
    over time).

-   Once the technical maximum is met, applications from new potential operators
    shall be considered in the order received as and when other SWAN Operators
    terminate their membership.

### Termination of Membership

-   SWAN Operators may choose to terminate their membership by giving notice to
    the SWANCo. There shall be a process to ensure the integrity of the SWAN
    network is maintained.

-   SWAN Operators’ membership may be terminated by the SWANCo due to breach of
    the membership requirements, and failure to remedy the breach within a
    prescribed period following notice from the SWANCo (pursuant to an agreed
    escalation procedure).

### Dispute Resolution

-   In the event of a dispute between members, there will be an arbitration
    process overseen by the Board.

-   In the event of a dispute between a member and the SWANCo, there will be an
    independent arbitration process.

-   In the event a complaint about a SWAN Operator is made to the SWANCo, there
    will be an agreed escalation procedure through which to address the
    complaint, overseen by the executive board. This will include a set
    timeframe for the SWAN Operator to remedy any breach of the SWAN membership
    rules.

### Company Formation

-   A UK [Community Interest Company limited](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-interest-companies-business-activities) by guarantee may be the most
    appropriate corporate vehicle for the SWANCo.
